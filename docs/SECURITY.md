# Security and privacy

Omakeez is an Omarchy shell plugin. Omarchy plugins are not sandboxed, so
installing one grants its QML, JavaScript, Lua, and helper scripts the normal
capabilities of the current user session. Review this repository and its
updates before installing them.

## What Omakeez reads

- The resolved Hyprland Lua configuration, only to inspect and safely manage
  Omakeez's own bridge block.
- `hyprctl binds` and the current XKB keymap, only to generate a display
  catalog and match allowlist.
- Omarchy shell state that exposes lock, Polkit credential-dialog, fullscreen,
  and lifecycle suppression.
- The generated `catalog.json` and `bridge-catalog.lua` files described below.

## What Omakeez writes

Only after the user reviews the exact diff and clicks the enable/disable action,
the controller may atomically edit the resolved Hyprland configuration target.
It writes local operational files in:

```text
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/omarchy/omakeez/
```

The leaf state directory is user-owned with mode `0700`; generated files use
mode `0600`. Catalog generation repairs legacy user-owned state directories
that were created with broader permissions and rejects symlinked or
foreign-owned output directories.

| File or directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `catalog.json` | Registered shortcut descriptions, modifier/key metadata, and opaque SHA-256 IDs. |
| `bridge-catalog.lua` | Compact local allowlist for the Hyprland bridge. |
| `bridge-control.lock` | Advisory lock that prevents concurrent bridge edits. |
| `backups/` | Protected rollback copy and metadata, created only for a configuration mutation. |

The catalog generator uses dispatcher arguments only while deriving opaque IDs.
It does not write those arguments into the catalog, bridge lookup, or protocol.

## Keyboard boundary

The small [bridge source](../bridge.lua) is the code linked from the Omakeez
setup panel. Its comments describe each boundary in place.

Hyprland invokes its callback for keyboard transitions. The bridge reads only a
numeric code and press/release state, retains an in-memory mask for `SUPER`,
`SHIFT`, `CTRL`, and `ALT`, and checks an exact allowlisted tuple. It emits only
guide lifecycle names, modifier names, or an opaque binding ID for a configured
match. It discards unmatched codes immediately and has no history buffer,
counter, timestamp log, or raw-key storage.

The bridge does not use `/dev/input`, evdev, sockets, subprocesses, root,
`sudo`, `pkexec`, a package manager, or network APIs. Its one local catalog
load can retry after asynchronous catalog generation; after that, normal input
matching is in-memory. The only external URL in the plugin is the user-clicked
browser link to the public bridge source.

Omakeez does **not** persist typed text, passwords, raw key sequences,
keybinding-use history, commands, dispatcher arguments, window titles,
application identifiers, or telemetry.

## Configuration safety

The controller accepts only a user-owned, writable, regular target with one
hard link, inside the user home or a user-owned Git root. It preserves a safe
symlink's target rather than replacing the symlink itself. Before replacement,
it checks the inspected content hash, creates a `0700` rollback directory with
`0600` contents, validates Lua syntax, reloads Hyprland, checks
`hyprctl configerrors`, and rolls back on a failed live mutation.

No elevated privileges are offered. If any check fails, automatic setup stops
and the panel provides a manual snippet instead.

## Auditing a live installation

1. Review [bridge.lua](../bridge.lua),
   [generate-catalog](../scripts/generate-catalog), and
   [bridge-control](../scripts/bridge-control).
2. Inspect the Omakeez state directory listed above; it should contain only the
   operational files described in this document.
3. Open the panel's **Review exact change** link before enabling.
4. Confirm the resolved Hyprland file contains exactly one guarded block:

   ```lua
   -- >>> Omakeez managed bridge >>>
   pcall(dofile, "…/io.github.cyprusad.omakeez/bridge.lua")
   -- <<< Omakeez managed bridge <<<
   ```

Use the installed plugin's controller for a live audit. A checkout embeds a
different bridge path and will correctly refuse to manage an installed block.
